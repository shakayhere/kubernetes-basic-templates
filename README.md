## Kubernetes Basic Code Templates 

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. These basic code templates provide a starting point for creating and deploying applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites
- A Kubernetes cluster set up and configured
kubectl command-line tool installed and configured to communicate with your cluster
- A basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts such as pods, services, and deployments
Deployment Template
- A deployment is the recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of pods in Kubernetes. The following is a basic deployment template:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This template creates a deployment named "my-app" that will run 3 replicas of a container using the "my-app:latest" image and exposed on port 80.

### Service Template
A service is used to expose pods to the network and provide a stable endpoint for external access. The following is a basic service template:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```
This template creates a service named "my-app-service" that will forward traffic to the pods selected by the "app=my-app" label on port 80.

Usage
To create a deployment and service using these templates, save the above YAML files as deployment.yaml and service.yaml respectively and run the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
You can verify the status of your deployment and service by running:

```
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get service
```
This is a basic example, and you can customize these templates according to your requirement.

### Note
It is important to note that, these are basic templates and you may need to make some changes or add more configuration to suit your particular use case. All folders contain exaxmples of some applications's manifest files, and how they can be used in kubernetes. Additionally, you may need to configure for security, logging, monitoring, and other production-related concerns.
